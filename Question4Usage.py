# Question 4:
# Custom Question:
# Create a file with appropriate file name, which contains only a collection of functions.
# In this file, write a set of functions to create your very own library.
# After creating this library, create another program file and
# write a program which makes use of most/all of the functions you have created in your custom library.
# The skyâ€™s the limit.
